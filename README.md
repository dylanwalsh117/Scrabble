# Scrabble

Implement a simple game of scrabble.
The user is given a set of 7 random letters, that can contain repetitions (several letters of the same type). 
The user can view the letters and then needs to start making words with the letters. 
Each letter has a score and based on that the score of the word will be calculated. 
The words can only be made from the set of letters available.

The program will keep track of the words entered and the total score. 
At the end, when the user is done entering words the program will list the words, their individual score and the total score.
